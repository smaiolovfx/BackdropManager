A backdrop manager for Nuke's backdrops.
Parts based on shortcutedtor by Ben Dickson.

This tool adds settings under /Edit/Backdrop Manager Settings, and a panel for ease of use under Windows/Custom/Backdrop Manager.

To use, in ~/.nuke/menu.py add this:
import BackdropManager

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions for how BackdropManager can be improved:
